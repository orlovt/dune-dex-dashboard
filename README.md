## Overview
This repository contains four SQL queries designed to analyze and rank decentralized exchange (DEX) activities, focusing on trade volumes, token transactions, and project metrics over specific periods. These queries help in understanding market trends, identifying top-performing projects, and tracking token activities on DEX platforms.

## Queries

### 1. [Daily DEX Volume](https://github.com/orlovt/dune-dex-dashboard/blob/main/queries/q1.sql)


**Description**: This query calculates the daily trading volume in USD for each project on a DEX over the past 30 days. 

**Application**: By providing a breakdown of daily volumes, this query helps in identifying trends and patterns in trading activities, allowing for better market analysis and decision-making.

### 2. [7-Day and 1-Day Project Volumes](https://github.com/orlovt/dune-dex-dashboard/blob/main/queries/q2.sql)

**Description**: This query ranks projects based on their trading volumes over the last 7 days and 1 day.

**Application**: By comparing weekly and daily volumes, stakeholders can identify projects with significant short-term and medium-term activity, useful for spotting emerging trends and potential investment opportunities.

### 3. [Token Volume Analysis](https://github.com/orlovt/dune-dex-dashboard/blob/main/queries/q3.sql)

**Description**: This query calculates and aggregates the trading volumes for tokens over the past 30 days, broken down into daily, weekly, and monthly periods.

**Application**: This query helps in monitoring token liquidity and trading activity over different timeframes, providing insights into token popularity and market dynamics.

### 4. [Top Projects by TVL](https://github.com/orlovt/dune-dex-dashboard/blob/main/queries/q4.sql)

**Description**: This query identifies the top 5 projects by Total Value Locked (TVL) in USD for each blockchain over the past 30 days.

**Application**: By ranking projects based on TVL, this query helps in identifying the most significant projects within each blockchain, indicating where the most value is being accumulated and potentially highlighting the most trusted and used projects.

## Conclusion

These queries provide valuable insights into DEX activities, helping analysts, investors, and stakeholders understand market trends, token liquidity, and project performance. By leveraging these queries, users can make informed decisions based on comprehensive data analysis.
